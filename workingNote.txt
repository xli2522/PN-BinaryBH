First we have to identify all the components needed to solve the Poisson Equation. 
According to the PDE solver package Fenics, there are FOUR steps:
    1. Identify the Computational (Spatial) Domain, the PDE itself, its boundary conditions, and source term f. 
    2. Reformulate the PDE as as finite element variational problem. 
    3. Write a program that defines the computational domain, the boundary conditions, and source terms.
    4. Call Fenics to solve the PDE and visualize the result. 
First, we need to figure out what step 1 and 2 are. 

    LaplaceX=2U is our Poisson (and we let xs = x1 and x'=x2 in the program)
    Accoding to the information, we have identified:
        the Laplace;
        the function X(xs)=-2* integral((U(x')/abs(Xs-x'))*d abs(x'))   (in spherical coordinate);
        the prescribed function - source quantity on the right side of the equation f = 2*U 
            where U = - (G*M)/(2*((epsilon**2+abs(x1-x2)**2)**delta)*delta);
        
        MY ASSUMPTION: 
        the spatial domain is [xs,x'] where xs is an arbitrary position 
        
        QUESTION: what is x'? is x' x prime or is it x2?
        QUESTION: we need the boundary of the spatial domain. what is it? Is it U(x') 

        Need: Boundary conditions on the boundary.

The justification for the above requirments is: To constitute a boundary-value problem, which is how the Fenics package solves PDEs, we need to have
    1. A stationary PDE,
    2. and a complete set of boundary conditions.

Once we have all of the information, we can start writing the code for solving our poisson equation.


In the code:

X_D is the boundary condition of the left side of the equation X, the potential due to the
